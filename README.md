# WordPress Plugin Collection

A curated set of modern WordPress plugins focused on marketing and conversion-ready components. Every plugin ships with a shortcode so you can embed the widget in posts, pages, or template parts without additional builders.

## Usage

1. Copy the desired plugin folder into your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin from **Plugins â†’ Installed Plugins**.
3. Paste the shortcode into any block that supports shortcodes (Group block, Paragraph, Site Editor, etc.).
4. Adjust shortcode attributes to match your brand voice, links, and imagery.

Each plugin directory contains a `readme.txt` with deeper configuration notes, attribute breakdowns, and usage tips.

## Development Notes

- CSS and JavaScript assets are enqueued only when their shortcode runs to keep payloads lean.
- Animations rely on the Intersection Observer API for performant reveal effects.
- Default content is provided for quick previews and can be overridden entirely via shortcode attributes.
