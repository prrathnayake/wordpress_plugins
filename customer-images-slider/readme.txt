Shortcode [customer_images size="large" columns="3" title="Happy Customers" product_id="" autoplay="true" delay="2500" speed="600"] renders a Customer Gallery Slide-inspired carousel that mirrors the global gallery styling. Images sit inside centered frames with hover and lightbox states, and the optional video column inherits the same dark shell treatment. All hero content is fetched from product ACF with clean fallbacks. Click any image/video to open fullscreen.

== How to Use ==
1. Install and activate the plugin, then assign the "Customer Images & Video" ACF field group (below) to the WooCommerce products you want to feature.
2. Upload customer gallery images, optionally add a product video, and fill in any hero fields while editing the product.
3. Insert the `[customer_images]` shortcode into a post, page, or template part. Adjust attributes such as `size`, `columns`, `title`, `autoplay`, and timing (see example above) to fit your layout.
